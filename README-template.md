## Overview
Coding this challenge was fairly easy on the HTML side, but I'd found the CSS part a bit hard and it took me sometimes before I could get what I really wanted to do.

## My process
The process I used to get the work done was first to display all the content using HTML and then proceeded with the stylings.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

What I learned from this challenge was how to use the max-width CSS property and also how to use the favicon.


### Continued development

Coding the challenge made me to do alot of research and I'd found a sh*t load of CSS concepts that am not aware or comfortable. I would love to master CSS(Flexbox, Grid, Animation) in the coming month.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp) - This website gave me a good understanding of width/height and max-width. I really liked the way they simplifies the content, it'll definitly be my go to website for references.
